# Social-Media-Analytics-for-Emergency-Response  (An iHELP Component) 

this was my graduation project for university and worked in a team of 3 students to implement the project.

- this is a Machine Learning model in python that uses disaster related data from Twitter (e.g. Earthquakes, Storms, etc.).
- classified it by the model to relevant or irrelevant by applying Logistic Regression.
- Managed the relevant data by weighing the importance of each element in the dataset Ascendingly by its frequency with TF-IDF approach then visualizing it using MS Power BI 
- new organised data is automatically sent to stakeholders to provide the needed amount of help and sent it to the disaster areas as soon as possible to save the lives of those in need
- Achieved 85% score for the iHelp Grad Project when represented in front of 4 Administrators, Dean and project Instructor
