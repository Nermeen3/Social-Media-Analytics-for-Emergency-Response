# Social-Media-Analytics-for-Emergency-Response  (An iHELP Component) 

this was my graduation project for university and worked in a team of 3 students to implement the project.

- This is a Machine Learning model in python that uses disaster related clean data from Twitter (e.g. Earthquakes, Storms, etc.) and classiffies it to relevant or irrelevant by applying Logistic Regression. The model weighed the importance of each element in the dataset Ascendingly by its frequency using TF-IDF approach

- My team's task was to carefully study the code and data then visualize new clean dataset using Microsoft PowerBI 
- The new organised data is automatically sent to stakeholders to provide the needed amount of help and sent it to the disaster areas as soon as possible to save the lives of those in need (new data is ideally sent to the main application which was out of work)
- I scored 85% for the iHelp Graduation Project when presented in front of 4 Administrators, Dean and project Instructor


this is the final visualization of the data using Ms PowerBi
